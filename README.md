Narayana Tomcat Integration
===========================

This project contains the source files required to integrate Narayana with Tomcat. This is by no means a verified solution, but it is one that has worked for me. Some of these source files we're found at the following location: http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/labs/labs/jbosstm/workspace/jhalliday/tomcat-integration and were not created by me. I'm just providing easier access to some files that already existed on the web and I've added a JBossTransactionManagerLookup class that I needed to make the integration work alongside Hibernate.

Enjoy!
